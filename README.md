Responsiveness: Sociopedia is designed to be responsive, allowing users to access the site on smaller screens with modified adjustments.

The working of the app relies on APIs created from scratch, which retrieve information from the backend database. The app's frontend is built using React, React Router for navigation, Formik and Yup for form creation and validation, and Redux Toolkit for state management, with data stored in local storage using Redux Persist and image uploads managed with React Dropzone.

The backend of the app is built using Node.js as the runtime, Express.js as the backend framework, Mongoose for database management, JSON Web Token for web authentication, and Multer for file uploading.
